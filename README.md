The implementation of an AI-based Netflix movie recommendation system is the focus of this initiative. The model is built on the ECLAT machine learning technique and recommends new movies based on the user's viewing history. The system has the potential to enhance the overall Netflix user experience by correctly recommending movies based on a user's interests.

Big Basket Prediction: This project is an AI-based predictive model that anticipates what goods a customer will most likely buy on the Indian online grocery store Big Basket. It does this by using the Apriori algorithm. The model examines the client's previous purchasing patterns and makes tailored product suggestions. Big Basket's sales may rise as a result of this initiative and customer satisfaction may rise.
