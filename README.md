Collection of data science and AI projects showcasing my skills in machine learning, deep learning, NLP, and computer vision.
The implementation of an AI-based Netflix movie recommendation system is the focus of this initiative. The model is built on the ECLAT machine learning technique and recommends new movies based on the user's viewing history. The system has the potential to enhance the overall Netflix user experience by correctly recommending movies based on a user's interests.

Big Basket Prediction: This project is an AI-based predictive model that anticipates what goods a customer will most likely buy on the Indian online grocery store Big Basket. It does this by using the Apriori algorithm. The model examines the client's previous purchasing patterns and makes tailored product suggestions. Big Basket's sales may rise as a result of this initiative and customer satisfaction may rise.

Breast cancer is a prevalent cancer type among women worldwide, and early detection is essential for successful treatment. In my project, I utilized logistic regression to develop a model for detecting breast cancer. Logistic regression is a statistical technique used for binary classification problems, and in the context of breast cancer, it predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign. To train the model, I used a dataset containing features related to breast tumors and divided the dataset into training and testing subsets. After training, I tested the model on the testing subset and achieved an accuracy of 96.49%, indicating that the model correctly classified 96.49% of breast tumors. The project's success demonstrates the potential for machine learning algorithms to aid in the early detection of breast cancer, leading to better patient outcomes.

The Zomato review analysis project is an application of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify Zomato reviews as positive or negative. The project uses a combination of NLP techniques such as text cleaning, tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal, along with machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes to classify the sentiment of the reviews. The accuracy of the model is evaluated using confusion matrix and accuracy score metrics, which show that the model is able to classify the sentiment of reviews with an accuracy of 71%
